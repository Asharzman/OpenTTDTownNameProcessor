# OpenTTD Town Name Processor
Very simple modding utility program that processes a list of names to be used in your OpenTTD (Open Transport Tycoon Deluxe) town/city namelist mod.
I mainly made it for myself to quickly go through long lists of names, because I am lazy and could not be bothered in doing them manually, so I instead
spend my time writing up this program to make this menial task.

## Installation

Extract the .exe to directory of your choice, put your text file with names in the same folder.

## Usage

You put the names you want to see in the mod into the names.txt (or some other name, as long as the file is .txt), then run the program and the names will be processed into correct format to be used in your mod!
